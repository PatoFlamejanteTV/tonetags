## Why should I use this?

This tone indicator is used on messages that could sound potentially sound rude. **{frontmatter.tag}** shows that there is no hard feelings, and that it's all {frontmatter.fullForm}.

<br />

## Examples within messages:

- hey leave me out of this {frontmatter.tag}
- would rather not {frontmatter.tag}
