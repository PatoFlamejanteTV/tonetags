This tone indicator is used to indicate that you're quoting {frontmatter.tag}. This tone indicator is similar to **/ref**, but used exclusively for {frontmatter.fullForm}.

## Why should I use this?

This tone indicator is useful when a statement may come off as concerning, rude, or confusing when not contextualized as a lyric. This is sometimes seen in chat application statuses where a user might post a concerning lyric when they're just a fan of the song being referenced.
