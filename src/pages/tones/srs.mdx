The tone indicator **{frontmatter.tag}** is used to declare seriousness.

<br />
<br />

## Why should I use this?

Sometimes messages can come across as unserious, and everyone percieves differently. Using the {frontmatter.tag} tone tag informs people that you're serious about the message.

<br />

## Examples within messages:

- you're pretty healthy {frontmatter.tag}
- you're sooo cool {frontmatter.tag}
